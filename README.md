# admission-form
Developed a web-based application for St. Aloysius College to streamline the 2023 online admission process, making student onboarding more efficient and organized. The platform allowed applicants to pre-fill personal, academic, and activity-related details from home, generate completed admission forms, and print them before arriving for interviews.
